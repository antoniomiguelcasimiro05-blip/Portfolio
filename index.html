          <h2>Using the Unit Circle in Real Life</h2>
          <p>
            The unit circle helps us see how objects move in circular paths like a Ferris wheel turning high above the ground.  
            Each cabin rises and falls smoothly showing how height changes with time.  
            By using the unit circle we can understand how far the cabin turns and how high it is at any point.  
            It connects motion and math in a way that makes sense in real life.

          <h2>The Ferris Wheel and the Unit Circle</h2>
          <p>
            A Ferris wheel shows how the unit circle works in real motion.  
            Each cabin moves in a perfect circle like a point rotating around the origin.  
            The angle of rotation shows how far the wheel has turned while the height of each cabin follows the sine of that angle.  
          </p>
          <p>
            When a cabin reaches the top the sine value is at its highest and when it moves to the bottom the sine value is at its lowest.  
            As the wheel turns the x and y positions of the cabin change based on cosine and sine moving in a repeating cycle.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Engineers use these ideas when designing Ferris wheels to make sure the movement is smooth the speed is steady and the wheel stays balanced.  
            This shows how math brings structure and precision to things we see and enjoy every day.

          <h2>Understanding the Unit Circle</h2>
          <p>
            The unit circle is a circle with a radius of one and its center at the origin (0,0) on the coordinate plane.  
            It helps us see how trigonometric functions work and how angles relate to sine and cosine values.  
            Every point on this circle fits the equation x² + y² = 1 showing that all points are the same distance from the center.  
          </p>

          <h2>Finding Points on the Unit Circle</h2>
          <p>
            To locate a point on the unit circle start at the positive x axis which represents 0° or 0 radians.  
            Move counterclockwise based on your chosen angle θ.  
            The coordinates of that point are x and y which represent cosθ and sinθ.  
            Because the radius of the circle is one the equation x² + y² = 1 is true for every position around it.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Sine Cosine and Tangent in the Unit Circle</h2>
          <p>
            Each point on the unit circle represents a pair of values x and y which are the cosine and sine of an angle θ measured from the positive x axis.  
            This means cosθ equals x and sinθ equals y.  
            From these values we can find tangent using the equation tanθ equals sinθ divided by cosθ or y divided by x.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The sine and cosine values always stay between 1 and -1 because the circle has a radius of one.  
            The unit circle completes a full rotation of 360° or 2π radians divided into four main parts 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°.  
            At 90° and 270° the cosine value becomes zero which makes the tangent undefined.  
          </p>
          <p>Example: Find tan 45°</p>
          <p>
            From the unit circle sin 45° equals 1 ÷ √2 and cos 45° equals 1 ÷ √2.  
            tan 45° equals 1 showing that both values are equal at this angle.  
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Summary of the Unit Circle</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of memorizing the entire unit circle I tried to understand how each angle connects to its sine and cosine values.  
            As the angle increases the point on the circle moves around smoothly and both sine and cosine shift between 1 and -1.  
          </p>
          <p>
            At 0° or 0 radians the point is at (1,0).  
            At 90° or π ÷ 2 radians it is at (0,1).  
            At 180° or π radians it is at (-1,0).  
            At 270° or 3π ÷ 2 radians it is at (0,-1).  
            When it reaches 360° or 2π radians it goes back to (1,0) completing one full turn.  
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern shows how sine and cosine repeat endlessly which helps me understand trigonometry more deeply instead of just memorizing numbers.

          <h2>Activity 5 Pairwise Midpoints and Distances Landmarks</h2>
          <p>
            This activity shows how to find midpoints and distances between known landmarks in the Philippines using the coordinate plane.  
            I picked five landmarks from different regions and used their coordinates to find how far apart they are.  
            It helped me see how math connects with real geography.  
          </p>

          <p>
            The landmarks I used were: Rizal Monument in Manila, Magellan’s Cross in Cebu, Barasoain Church in Bulacan,  
            Fort Pilar in Zamboanga, and Banaue Rice Terraces in Ifugao.
          </p>

          <p>
            Computed midpoints and distances were as follows: <br>
            • Rizal Monument and Magellan’s Cross midpoint (122.4407, 12.4378), distance 5.19° ≈ 576 km. <br>
            • Rizal Monument and Barasoain Church midpoint (120.8956, 14.7110), distance 0.31° ≈ 34 km. <br>
            • Rizal Monument and Fort Pilar midpoint (121.5247, 10.7488), distance 7.75° ≈ 860 km. <br>
            • Rizal Monument and Banaue Rice Terraces midpoint (121.0585, 15.7561), distance 2.35° ≈ 261 km. <br>
            • Magellan’s Cross and Barasoain Church midpoint (122.3569, 12.5662), distance 5.50° ≈ 610 km.
          </p>

          <h3>Analysis and Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Doing this made me realize how math helps in mapping and geography.  
            The farthest distance was between Rizal Monument and Fort Pilar, showing how far apart Luzon and Mindanao are.  
            The closest was between Rizal Monument and Barasoain Church, both found in important historical places.  
            Overall, it was interesting to see how math can describe the real layout of our country.
